# Site showing a 5 day weather forecast
## uses bootstrap, jQuery, the open weather maps API, and the Google maps API


#### For each city you search for a row will appear with the map of the city, the 5 day forecast, high and low temperatures for each day, and the icon associated with the given forecast.

* To run locally download files and open `index.html` in your favorite browser


  #### What I would like to change in the future
 * Create a mobile layout, the current layout does not scale down well
 * Currently only US cities are searchable, and only one city with the same name will come up (for example searching for "Portland" will default to Portland OR, and not give you a Portland ME option)
 * Add more validation, currently doesn't give feedback if no string is entered. A random string for the city will return whatever the open weather map API guesses it is.
